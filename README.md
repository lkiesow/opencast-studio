### Installation

Just serve the files of this repository over https (needed). The application needs to be the root of a domain to work.

If you want to use your own Opencast server with this software, you need to allow CORS requests (with credentials) to your Opencast server. Additionally you need a workflow, which inspects the media and updates the length information.
